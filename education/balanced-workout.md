## Creating a Balanced Workout Routine

Tips for designing a well-rounded exercise program that includes cardio, strength, and flexibility.

### Key Components
*   **Cardiovascular Exercise (Cardio):** Activities that raise your heart rate (running, swimming, cycling, brisk walking). Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity per week.
*   **Strength Training:** Exercises using resistance (weights, bands, bodyweight) to build muscle. Target major muscle groups at least 2 days per week.
*   **Flexibility and Mobility:** Stretching, yoga, or dynamic movements to improve range of motion and prevent injury. Include regularly.
*   **Rest and Recovery:** Crucial for muscle repair and preventing overtraining. Schedule rest days.
