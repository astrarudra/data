## Budget-Friendly Meal Planning

Strategies for planning nutritious meals without breaking the bank.

### Cost-Saving Tips
*   **Plan Around Sales:** Check grocery store flyers and build meals around discounted items.
*   **Buy in Bulk:** Purchase grains, beans, and spices in bulk when cheaper.
*   **Use Less Expensive Proteins:** Incorporate beans, lentils, eggs, and tofu more often.
*   **Cook from Scratch:** Avoid pre-packaged or pre-cut items which cost more.
*   **Minimize Food Waste:** Plan meals to use up ingredients you already have. Repurpose leftovers.

*   **Limit Eating Out:** Cooking at home is almost always more economical.
