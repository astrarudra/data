## Fiber: The Unsung Hero of Digestive Health

Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot digest, yet it plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health.

### What Is Fiber?

Fiber is the indigestible part of plant foods that passes relatively intact through the stomach, small intestine, and colon. There are two main types:

* **Soluble fiber:** Dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance. Found in oats, beans, apples, and citrus fruits.
* **Insoluble fiber:** Does not dissolve in water and adds bulk to stool. Found in whole grains, nuts, and vegetables.

### Recommended Daily Intake

The USDA recommends:
* 25-38 grams of fiber daily for adults
* Most Americans only consume about half of this recommendation
