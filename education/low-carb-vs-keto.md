## Low-Carb Diets vs. Keto: What's the Difference?

Clarifying the nuances between general low-carb diets and the stricter ketogenic diet.

### Key Distinctions
*   **Carbohydrate Limits:** Keto is very low-carb (typically <50g/day, often <20g) to induce ketosis. Low-carb diets have a broader range (often 50-150g/day) and may not aim for ketosis.
*   **Fat Intake:** Keto emphasizes very high fat intake (70%+ of calories). Low-carb diets may have high fat, but often prioritize protein more.
*   **Protein Intake:** Keto requires moderate protein to avoid interfering with ketosis. Low-carb diets often feature higher protein intake.
*   **Goal:** Keto's primary goal is metabolic ketosis. Low-carb aims to reduce carb intake for various reasons (blood sugar control, weight loss) without necessarily reaching ketosis.
