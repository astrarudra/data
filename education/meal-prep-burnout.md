## Overcoming Meal Prep Burnout

Feeling tired of meal prepping? Tips to stay motivated and keep it interesting.

### Keeping it Fresh
*   **Try New Recipes:** Introduce 1-2 new recipes each week.
*   **Vary Components:** Switch up grains, proteins, and vegetables regularly.
*   **Use Different Flavors:** Experiment with new spices, herbs, and sauces.
*   **Prep Components, Not Meals:** Gives more flexibility for assembly during the week.
*   **Take Breaks:** It's okay to skip a week or prep less intensely sometimes.
*   **Focus on Enjoyment:** Choose recipes you genuinely look forward to eating.
*   **Simplify:** If feeling overwhelmed, scale back the complexity or number of meals prepped.
