## Meal Prepping for Different Diets

Tailoring your meal prep strategy to fit specific dietary needs like keto, vegan, or gluten-free.

### Key Considerations
*   **Keto:** Focus on prepping high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carb components (cooked meats, non-starchy veggies, healthy fats).
*   **Vegan:** Batch cook plant-based proteins (lentils, beans, tofu), grains, and roast various vegetables.
*   **Gluten-Free:** Ensure all ingredients (sauces, grains) are certified gluten-free. Prep GF grains and safe proteins/veggies.
*   **High-Protein:** Cook large batches of lean proteins (chicken, fish, eggs, legumes) and pair with complex carbs and veggies.
*   **Low-Carb:** Similar to keto but potentially less restrictive. Prep proteins and non-starchy vegetables.
