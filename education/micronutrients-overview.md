## Micronutrients: Vitamins and Minerals Explained

An overview of essential vitamins and minerals, their functions, and common food sources.

### Vitamins
*   **Fat-Soluble (A, D, E, K):** Stored in the body's fatty tissues. Require fat for absorption.
    *   *A:* Vision, immune function (Carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach).
    *   *D:* Bone health, calcium absorption (Sunlight, fatty fish, fortified milk).
    *   *E:* Antioxidant (Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils).
    *   *K:* Blood clotting, bone health (Leafy greens, broccoli).
*   **Water-Soluble (B vitamins, C):** Not stored in large amounts, need regular intake.
    *   *B Vitamins (Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folate, B12, etc.):* Energy metabolism, nerve function (Whole grains, meat, eggs, legumes, leafy greens).
    *   *C:* Antioxidant, immune function, collagen production (Citrus fruits, berries, peppers).

### Minerals
*   **Macro-minerals (Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride):** Needed in larger amounts.
    *   *Calcium:* Bone health, muscle function (Dairy, leafy greens, fortified foods).
    *   *Potassium:* Fluid balance, nerve signals (Bananas, potatoes, spinach).
*   **Trace Minerals (Iron, Zinc, Iodine, Selenium, Copper, etc.):** Needed in smaller amounts.
    *   *Iron:* Oxygen transport (Red meat, beans, spinach).
    *   *Zinc:* Immune function, wound healing (Meat, shellfish, legumes, seeds).
