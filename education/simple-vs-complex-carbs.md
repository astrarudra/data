## Understanding Carbohydrates: Simple vs. Complex

Not all carbs are created equal. Learn the difference between simple and complex carbohydrates and their impact on health.

### Simple Carbohydrates
*   **Structure:** Made of one or two sugar molecules.
*   **Digestion:** Quickly digested and absorbed, leading to rapid blood sugar spikes.
*   **Sources:** Sugary drinks, candy, white bread, pastries, fruit juice, table sugar, honey.
*   **Impact:** Provide quick energy but often lack fiber and nutrients. Can contribute to energy crashes and weight gain if overconsumed.

### Complex Carbohydrates
*   **Structure:** Made of long chains of sugar molecules (starches and fiber).
*   **Digestion:** Digested more slowly, leading to a gradual increase in blood sugar.
*   **Sources:** Whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa), legumes (beans, lentils), starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas), non-starchy vegetables.
*   **Impact:** Provide sustained energy, typically rich in fiber and nutrients, promote satiety and digestive health.
