## Time-Saving Meal Prep Hacks

Even with planning, meal prep can feel time-consuming. These hacks can help streamline the process.

### Efficient Tips

*   **Use Appliances:** Utilize slow cookers, pressure cookers (Instant Pot), or air fryers for hands-off cooking.
*   **One-Pan/Pot Meals:** Minimize cleanup by cooking everything together.
*   **Prep Ingredients, Not Full Meals:** Chop veggies, marinate protein, or make sauces in advance for quick assembly later.
*   **Double Recipes:** Cook extra servings of dinners to use for lunches.
*   **Simplified Chopping:** Use a food processor for chopping large amounts of vegetables.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Don't try to make overly complex recipes during your main prep session.
