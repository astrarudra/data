## Understanding the Ketogenic (Keto) Diet

The ketogenic diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.

### How it Works

By drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat, the body enters a metabolic state called ketosis. In ketosis, the body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain.

### Potential Benefits

*   **Weight Loss:** Often significant in the initial stages.
*   **Improved Blood Sugar Control:** Beneficial for type 2 diabetes management.
*   **Increased Mental Focus:** Some individuals report enhanced clarity.

### Key Principles

*   **Very Low Carbs:** Typically under 20-50 grams per day.
*   **Moderate Protein:** Enough to preserve muscle mass.
*   **High Fat:** The majority of calories come from healthy fats.

### Important Considerations

Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any restrictive diet like keto, especially if you have underlying health conditions.
