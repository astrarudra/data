## Meal Prep Basics: Save Time and Eat Better

Meal prepping is the practice of preparing meals or meal components in advance to save time, reduce stress, and promote healthier eating habits.

### Benefits of Meal Prepping

* **Saves time:** Cook once, enjoy multiple meals throughout the week
* **Reduces decision fatigue:** No need to decide what to eat for every meal
* **Controls portions:** Pre-portioned meals help prevent overeating
* **Saves money:** Less impulse takeout and reduced food waste
* **Improves nutrition:** Plan balanced meals ahead instead of making last-minute choices

### Essential Meal Prep Equipment

* **Quality food storage containers:** Glass or BPA-free plastic with secure lids
* **Kitchen scale:** For portion control and recipe accuracy
* **Meal prep containers:** Compartmentalized options keep foods separate
* **Sharp knives:** Makes vegetable prep faster and safer
* **Cutting boards:** Separate boards for meat and produce prevent cross-contamination
* **Sheet pans:** Perfect for roasting large batches of vegetables
* **Instant Pot or slow cooker:** For hands-off cooking of proteins and stews

### Step-by-Step Meal Prep Process

1. **Plan your menu:** Decide what meals you'll prepare for the week
2. **Make a shopping list:** Organize by grocery store sections
3. **Shop efficiently:** Stick to your list to avoid impulse purchases
4. **Prep ingredients:** Wash, chop, and portion raw ingredients
5. **Batch cook staples:** Prepare grains, proteins, and roasted vegetables
6. **Assemble meals:** Portion out complete meals or store components separately
7. **Label and store:** Mark containers with contents and date prepared
8. **Strategize consumption:** Eat meals with the shortest shelf life first

### Maintaining Variety to Prevent Meal Fatigue

* Use different spice blends for the same protein

* Using poor quality containers that leak or don't seal well

Meal prepping doesn't have to mean eating the same thing every day. With smart planning and the right techniques, you can enjoy convenient, healthy, and delicious meals all week long.
